        <h3>Your Kisses Are So Addicting! 👄</h3>
        <p class="kiss-description">How can one person bring so much joy into my life just by pressing
          their lips onto mine?! I can never have enough of your kisses. They are so warm, cute, and luscious!
          If I had an addiction, it would be your kisses and I don’t think I can go a day without them.</p>

        <h3>I am so Proud of Everything You Have Achieved! 🥰</h3>
        <p class="grad-description">From the first day we’ve started dating, I have seen you grow so much already
          from every achievement you’ve accomplished. Watching you graduate in your field of study to getting a job
           in that field in 3-4 months! Not many people can say that the have done that! I am so proud of you, and I
           can’t wait to be part of every milestone you achieve!</p>

      <h3> Were Meant For Each Other 👨‍❤️‍💋‍👨</h3>
      <p class="stampede-description">I couldn’t count the number of similarities we’ve had since we started talking
        to each other. Some relationships are like oil and water, but how I see ours, we are like dirt and worms 🐛.
        Our initials and birthdays are practically the same!! You somehow make me feel so comfortable and vulnerable
        at the same time, you have helped me grow so much in the year we were together. I want to help support you and
        be by your side forever just how you’ve helped me!</p>

    <h3>Experiencing New Things With You 🏌️‍♂️🏌️‍♀️</h3>
    <p class="zoo-description">Experiencing new things with you is something that I would have probably not do on my own and so I
      love experiencing new things with you because it takes me out of my comfort zone. We can make new memories together and talk
      while laughing about them. There so many things I enjoyed doing with you and that’s because we experienced them together.</p>
