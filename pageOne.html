        <h3>Eating Alone is Not Fulfilling Without You 🍕🍔</h3>
        <p class="dinner-description">It never feels right eating without you. Whether its just having a snack or a full meal, my heart
          is not full without having you to share food with. Some of my favorite memories is when we are eating together.
          I still remember that rice being flicked at me so clearly. </p>

        <h3>Holidays are Better with You 🥳</h3>
        <p class="christmas-description">Whether it'd be Valentines, Christmas, long weekend or our birthdays, everything feels much better when
           I have you to celebrate these things with. I never really look forward to those days until I started spending them with you and I am
           always looking forward to them all the time now!</p>

      <h3>My Love Grows For You Everyday 💜</h3>
      <p class="valentines-description">Your heart is so big and its only right that my heart grew so big for you! I see the love and joy you show to
         the people you love and care for, animals too! My heart grows fonder when I see you cry for the little things, it really makes me love you even
         more knowing how empathetic you are. </p>

    <h3>I Feel Guilty if I have Dessert Without You 🍦🍬</h3>
    <p class="dessert-description">Okay… I can’t pick up a dessert now without thinking of you even once. How can I enjoy these treats and desserts
      without the love of my life to share it with. I’ve always loved how you said that there is always room for dessert no matter how full you are
      from the previous meal, and I love how you never fail to make room for them! </p>
